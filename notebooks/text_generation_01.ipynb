    "## Understanding Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is one of the most complex aspects of our existence. We use language to communicate our thoughts and choices. Every language is defined with a list of characters called the alphabet, a vocabulary and a set of rules called grammar. Yet it is not a trivial task to understand and learn a language. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes years for a human to grasp a few languages, let alone become a master of it. Most languages have vast vocabularies which are ever expanding along with complex and fuzzy grammatical rules and structures. We see/think and write/share differently. To put simply, languages are ambiguous. The ambiguity, sarcasm, context, and continuous changes to usage patterns are some of the challenges associated with language."
